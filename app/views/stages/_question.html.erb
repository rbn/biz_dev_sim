    The best answer is 4, “establishing a rapport.”  While all of these answers have merit, remember this is your “first” in-person meeting with a prospective client.   What you’re really after in this meeting is a mutual sense that you and the your prospective client can establish a productive, downstream working relationship.  Remember, this business is not a “quick sale and a walk-away.”  You’re trying a to establish a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.  Your potential client is also sizing you up during the meeting:  “Can I work with this person?  Are they really making an effort to understand my requirement? …Etc.”    The other possible answers are also very important, but this kind of information will likely evolve from future contact with your prospective client.  If you don’t establish a reasonable rapport with the client in the first meeting (“first base” if you will), it’s unlikely you’ll ever make it to “second base.”
